"""
Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm

This algorithm is used to traverse or search tree or graph data structures.
It starts from a given node (root or source) and explores all neighboring nodes at the current depth level
before moving on to the next depth level.

Problem:

Calculate the shortest distance from a single source to all other vertices in an unweighted graph using BFS algorithm.

Input: A simple undirected graph with n â‰¤ 10^3 vertices in adjacency list format.

Output: An array D[1..n] storing the shortest path length from vertex 1 to vertex i (D[1]=0).
If vertex i is unreachable from 1, set D[i] to -1.

Procedure:

1. Read input file
2. Create graph from adjacency list
3. Use BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex i
4. Output the result
